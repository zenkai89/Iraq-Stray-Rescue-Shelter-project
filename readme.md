# Iraq-Stray-Rescue-Shelter-project

  I've worked in humanitarian NGOs for more than 10 years in Kurdistan, with international NGOs Peace Winds Japan, Handicap International, and Adelby School. 
We have supported all kinds of vulnerable people who have been displaced from surrounding areas like Shingal, refugees like Syrian people, or host communities like Mousel.
The first big wave of people that were refuged and displaced in Iraq was between 2011-2014 then gradually more people came and more camps were opened during that time.
I have worked on various projects in protection, project supervision, food voucher distribution, and non-food item distribution. After the situation of those people was mitigated we thought of starting of supporting animals that are homeless, without food and shelter. 
Every day hundreds of cats and dogs die due to hunger, car accidents, and abuse in Iraq and are thrown in the streets their babies face the same fate. 
We tried to open a local NGO related to animal rescue and shelter last year but we were delayed till we recently got the approval of it. However, we had a US-based doner but unfortunately due to the recent Trumps decisions our fund was declined and we had to postpone until we find another way to help that vulnerable animal.
Our project was to build shelters in the urban areas and rent trained workers, workers, vans, and built fences in specific areas that we got approval from the government.
Finally, I came to conclude that there is another way that we can help them since we have approval for the project and everything in my country for the project, there are other ways that people can donate since Iraq is very restricted in dealing with USD people can donate by Crypto currency which is easier and takes less interest of the transportation and banking. 
Your donations help us build shelters, provide veterinary care, and rescue more animals. You can donate through traditional methods or cryptocurrency.
